$aboutMe_objective = "An oportunity to work and have full commitment to not just upgrading oneself, but to be apart of a bleeding edge technology company and output my talent into a competetive edge to further the company. Currently, I am a fanatic about Ethereum and expand my solid experience in Smart Contract design through my eager work ethic to write Solidity code. I focus on professionality in my work, using my interpersonal skills to build strong relationships with co-workers, allowing a dynamic workplace with clear communication at its core. I hope to learn more about topics such as Blockchain Scaling and Minimum Consensus protocols. As an individual, I am usually uniquely creative, funny, and very passionate about my work. I'm a forward thinker and a great member of any team, as I can easily control when to be ascertive or when to be commanded.";

In my spare time I program in PHP, SQL, JavaScript (and it's libs), Java, PL.SQL, C++, HTML5, Python3, Visual Basic .NET, Processing (c++ derivitive), and of course solidity; my new favourite language to develop in.";

Ever since that day, I have always thought of its implementation into other vices than currency; Decentralised Organisations, Transparent Spending Trails for Public Organisations, Transparency and Automation in Political Voting Systems, and Proof of Ownership Systems. One of the greatest achievements I plan to make in my life is to develop one of these systems. In 2016 I decided to create a social media platform using the blockchain; each peer was a microcontroller (100 Arduinos). Although this project was a failure, it greatly increased my knowledge of Consensus and cheating on the blockchain."),

I can develop in low level languages such as C++ (and some C) for legacy systems, or high level scripts to automate a couple keystrokes in Python3."),

This does not mean cutting down staff, but more so expanding the business so you have 7 free staff members which could potentially quadruple the output of the business.
